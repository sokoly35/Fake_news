# Fake News Detector

If you have any problems with rendering IPython Notebook file I recommend to paste its link in [Jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## Overview

In the days of social media, fake news can be extremely dangerous weapon in the wrong hands. People should prepare yourself for defending against such a weapon. This project is a binary classification with natural language processing problem. Our goal is to predict if given text is or is not a fake news. In this project I also focus on to optimize the learning process by using tools like regular expressions and dimensionality reduction algorithms. The dataset comes from [this](https://data-flair.trainin) site.

## Motivation

It was my "Hello world" to NLP task as also as it was my first serious project. I was searching some fine projects to do in [data-flair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/machine-learning-project-ideas/) service. I found presented fake news detection is very important nowadays and it really suits for an introduction to data science projects. I found that logistic regression was indeed good pick to this problem, so I focused on evaluating it mainly. Especially, because I presented this detectors result on the seminar from mathematics for industries.

## Errors

If you found any mistakes in the project, please let me know about in [here](https://github.com/sokoly35/Data_science_portfolio/issues) adding a short note that it is from this project.
